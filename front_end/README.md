# Labs10-Taco-Run

### Welcome to our Labs 10 project: Taco Run, an app made to eat tacos, and make friends along the way
---
## Why build an App Like this?
- Across the globe, there are millions of tacos eaten per year, but nowhere to keep track of where those yummy, scrumptious, mouth-watering tacos came from! 

  - Here at Taco Run we aim to make the taco-tracking process as simple as possible. Got a taco place you loved? Just add the name and location under your `favorites` tab!

- Taco eating is not an activity that is done alone either. 

  - Yup you guessed it, the Taco Run app handles that too! As a team, we noticed in the age of social media, that there seems to never be a time where we can get to meet new people and that is __no bueno__. 
  
  - We as a group wanted to create an app that fills the gap in interaction, allowing users to meet up over a shared interest of tacos!
