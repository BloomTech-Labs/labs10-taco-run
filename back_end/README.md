## Back-End Dependencies ```(Production)```
### ExpressJS

A prebuilt NodeJS framework that makes creating server side applications simple, fast, and flexible. NodeJS is powered by Google's V8 Engine which means it's powerful and can handle a large number of requests without lapsing in dependability. Also, this means that this is a highly scalable choice when you consider the Event Loop which manages all asynchronous operations allowing the program to continue to run as expected without stops. | [View Dependency](http://expressjs.com/)
